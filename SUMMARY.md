The biggest thing I learned this semester is how to debug functional programs. Before this semester if I saw my functional program misbehaving I would know what was going wrong. AI is too complex for me to be able to do that with. The strategies I learned were, split up functions into smaller pieces, use Debug.Trace, and use ghci to test my functions **and** library functions because they would not always act like how you would think.

I also learned about setting up UI in a sensible manor, witch is something I had not thought about when it came to my programs. I really liked the challenge of highlighting the checkers, while I had other ideas I am very happy with how they turned out.

Overall this was a great project that I got a lot out of and can be used on my resume.
