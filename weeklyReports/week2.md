# Week 2

	My project is to create a group of text terminal games (Tik-Tac-Toe, Chess, Chekers, and Connect 4) in haskell. I want to expore functional programing in the context of a large(-ish) application. I also want to explore the Basic Logic of these games in the context of a "stateless system". I have also realy never had to think about UI in the terminal and how to handle it, so I look forward to that chalange.

	I also want  to add an AI partner to most of the games. For Tik-Tac-Toe I and to impliment the minimax algorithm. For some games like chess I might not get to an AI beond picking random moves. But for games like Tik-Tac-Toe and Connect 4 I should be able to compleate there AI.
